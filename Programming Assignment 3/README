Description:--------------------------------------------------------
PA3 is a program that takes in user inputted strings to find
anagrams in a file. This is accomplished using struct anagramInfo 
which contains dyndamically alloated array of sorted struct anagram 
objects struct anagram matches which contains info on word entered 
pointers to anagrams and the struct aangram which contains 
the word and sorted word.

Anagrams are words such that when lowercased they are the same. 
Anagrams does not count words that are exactly the same.


Compilation:------------------------------------------------------
To compile the program, type in the command make(themakefile
specifies how to derive the target program)

How to Run:-------------------------------------------------------
To run the program after typing in make, type in 
./anagrams and add 1 argument which is the file you want 
to search through for anagrams

Sample Output:----------------------------------------------------
Normal output.....

./anagrams four_anagrams.txt 

Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: post

Anagram(s) are: spot stop tops

Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]:


Abnormal output.....

./anagrams abc
makeAnagramTable failed: No such file or directory

Usage: ./anagrams dictionary_file

./anagrams

Usage: ./anagrams dictionary_file

How I Tested---------------------------------------------------------
To test this file, I entered in all the values given in the writeup
and see if it matched the output. i.e. ./anagrams four_anagrams.txt
./anagrams, ./anagrams abc

Additionally, I created tests that accounted for a variety of
different capitalized and anagram words inside the file. For instance,
HELLO hello Hello HElLo and determined if there were any edge cases 
I needed to test and to make sure it correctly returned anagrams
that were case=insensitive but also could not be the same word.
