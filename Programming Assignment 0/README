PA0 README---------------------------------------------

Author: Mark Huang
Userid: cs30xcl

Date: January 13,2015

Description:------------------------------------------
PA0 is a program that prints out onto the 
terminal window a message that says "Welcome to CSE 30,
Winter 2015 , PA0 is due on January, 13 2015, and the
square of a number inputted by the user.

Compilation:-------------------------------------------
To compile the program, type in the command make(the
makefile specifies how to derive the target program)

To run the program after typing in make, type in
./a.out

Sample Output:----------------------------------------
Normal output...

$./a.out 5

	Welcome to CSE 30, Winter 2015
	PA0 is due on January 13, 2015
	The square of 5 is 25

Abnormal output...

$./a.out

	./a.out: missing integer arg
	Usage: ./a.out [INTEGER]
	  Integer value to square

$./a.out 10 3

	./a.out: too many arguments
	Usage: ./a.out [INTEGER]
	  Integer value to square

Questions:--------------------------------------------
--1)error: implicit function declaration: fprintf line 53 of
the file main.c
	To fix, add #include <stdio.h> in main.c.
  
(20) error: syntax requires ";" after last struct/union member
(20) error: syntax error before or at: unsigned
(21) error: syntax requires ";" after last struct/union member
(21) error: syntax error before or at: unsigned
(22) error: syntax requires ";" after last struct/union member
in the file pa0.h
	To fix, simply add semi-colons after the member declarations
	in pa0.h.

(32) error: dubious tag declaration: struct DueDate
(34) error: undefined struct/union member: month
(34) error: undefined struct/union member: day
(34) error: undefined struct/union member: year
lint: errors in printDueDate.c; no output created
in the file printDueDate.c
	TO fix, add #include "pa0.h" in the file printDueDate.c.

(87) error: argument #1 is incompatible with prototype:
prototype: pointer to const struct DueDate {unsigned int year} : "pa0.h", 
line 25 in the file main.c.
	To fix, change the argument in printDueDate to &dueDate
	in the file main.c

main.c:93:3warning: format '%d' expects argument of type 'int', but
arguemtn 2 has type 'char *' [-WFormat=]
(void)printf( STR_SQUARENUM, argv[1], squareNum( argVal)); in the file
main.c
	To fix, add atoi(argv[1]) in the file main.c

--2)The program was not printing the correct output after successful compilation
because the EXPECTED_ARGS was not equal to the argc so the err message always
ran. To fix it, I changed the EXPECTED_ARGS to 2.

--3)int argVal=0;

--4)--argVal;nexti executes "one machine instruction, and 
if it is a function call
proceeds until the function returns"; it shows 13

--5)it examines the string. "Winter 2015" is printed

--6)The breakpoint is at main. You set one by typing in break main. Or the line
number you want to break in a particular file.

--7)You are debugging the sethi function.

--8)Step continues the program to the line before what is printed out on the gdb
and next actually runs that line of code. Stepi and Nexti are different in that
stepi "executes one machine instruction, then stop and return to the debugger."
nexti "executes one machine function, and if it is a function call continues
until the function returns."

--9.$i0, $o0 refers to inside and outside parameters respectively.

--10)X shows you the contents of a memory address whereas p shows you the value
stored in a named variable. You should use x to look at 
the contents of a register.
You should use p to look at something in memory.Examine a string and print 
variable as a signed integer, respectively.

--11) git rm --cached

--12)git log

--13)put *.whatever you don't want or filenames in .gitignore

--14).git
